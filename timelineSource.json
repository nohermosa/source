          "text": "<p>On March 31, 2015, the FTC <a href='https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/03/phoebe-putney-health-system-inc-hospital-authority-albany'>announced</a> that it had reached a consent agreement with Phoebe Putney Health System, the Hospital Authority of Albany-Doughtery County and HCA concerning the Hospital Authority's acquisition of a hospital from HCA, a deal the FTC deemed anticompetitive. The post-Supreme Court settlement reached is similar to the one proposed in 2013 and: (1) requires Phoebe Putney and the Hospital Authority to give the FTC prior notice before acquiring any part of a hospital or a controlling interest in other healthcare providers in the Albany, Georgia area; (2) prohibits the Hospital Authority and Phoebe Putney from opposing a Certificate of Need application for a general acute-care hospital in the Albany area; and (3) contains a stipulation that the effect of the transaction may be substantially to lessen competition within the relevant service and geographic markets alleged in the complaint."

The FTC further explained that it was concerned that the COPA laws would be used to immunize transactions with anticompetitive effects, and that this would result in higher health care prices for consumers."
